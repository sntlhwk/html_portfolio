<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm a passionate and spiritual individual with a love for creativity. I enjoy expressing 
my thoughts and ideas through writing, photography, art, and find joy in researching human potential. Whether it be through 
consciousness, history, or culture, I always strive to understand the mind body spirit connection through my projects. 
My goal is innovation through connection, bridging technology with healing, empathy and humanity. With my background in fine art
and psychology I believe we can transcend human narratives through the support of intentional systems, creating a new
paradigm and bringing us closer together.</p>


<p>I enjoy art, coffee, jazz and travel.</p>
